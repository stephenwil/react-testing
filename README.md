Stephen Wilson, React Test Submittal

*Notes*
This app contains a simple express server to act as a mock back end, to a simple React + Redux app that
has a component which fetches data and renders that data.

The app also has the ability to add to the list of rendered data, and to click on each rendered item to allow editing of each cake item.

React bootstrap is used lightly to provide some simple nice UI

*Usage*

yarn start will concurrently start express and the react app
yarn test will run some tests
